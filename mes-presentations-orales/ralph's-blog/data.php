subject(1, "The plane crash", "After I lost consciousness, I got off the plane. I didn't know where I was. I looked around me. There was a big forest. I advanced, there was a beach. I thought for a moment. We probably were on an deserted island… without any grown ups.");

subject(2, "The first meeting", "A few moments later, I saw someone coming from the forest. He told me he was named Piggy (what is this name ?!). After that, I found a shell (a conch). Piggy had a idea. He told me to blow it and call the others. I tried and a deep and harsh sound echoed all over the island. Everyone else came. We started a meeting.
</br></br>We first voted for the chief and I was elected. Then, Jack, Simon and I, we climbed the mountain, saw water all around, and confirmed that we really were on an island.");

subject(3, "The fire", "When we (Jack, Simon and me) returned from the mountain, I called a meeting.
</br></br>First, I announced  them that we were on a beautiful island.
</br></br>Then, a littlun said that he saw a \"beastie\" and we started a huge talk about it.
</br></br>Finally, I said that we will certainly be rescued and that we can help people finding us by making a huge fire on the mountain.
</br></br>When we arrived on the mountain, things turned unfortunately wrong. We caused a big forest fire.");

subject(4, "Nice work…", "The days passed and I noticed that no one really worked on the island. We always have meeting to decide things we would do, but people start it without finishing it.
</br></br>Plus, Jack always talks about hunt and doesn't care about being rescued which is way more important.");

subject(5, "The ship", "While I was on the beach, I suddenly noticed a ship passing by the island. We would finally return home… or not. I looked at the top of the mountain: There was no smoke! I ran and yelled at the ship to come back. It passed in front of us without seeing anything.
</br></br>A few minutes later, Jack, his hunters and the two that were responsible of the fire came back from a big hunt with a pig. I couldn't believe they let a great chance to return home for a pig.
</br></br>At night, they all had a big feast.");

subject(6, "The assembly", "This day, I decided to have an assembly to make things clear.
</br></br>First, we sometimes decide something but it doesn't get done.
</br></br>Second, some littluns don't go in the right place when they're getting short.
</br></br>Third, the fire is this most important thing on the island and we'll only have it on the mountain.
</br></br>Fourth et finally, people start getting frightened.
</br></br>We didn't get to finish the meeting because Jack didn't want to listen to the rest, he made everyone else abandon the assembly, and he ruined everything (again).
");

subject(7, "Does the beast exist ?", "While I was sleeping, I was awakened by the twins, saying that they saw the beast on the mountain. I immediately called a meeting.
</br></br>After everyone was awake, the twins told them what they saw. They all became more frightened but Jack seemed happy to have a real hunt.
");

subject(8, "Beast on the mountain", "After what the twins said before, Jack, his hunters and I went to the top of the mountain to see if there really was a beast.
</br></br>When we arrived, I saw what I couldn't believe before. I saw a big creature with teeth and black eyes.
");

subject(9, "Bye, bye Jack", "When we returned from the mountain, meeting was called… by Jack.
</br></br>He announced that the beast really exist. He also said that I told him his hunters were no good, which wasn't true. He continued by saying I was a coward. I tried to stop him, but I couldn't. He said that I just give orders and expect others to obey for nothing.
</br></br>He finished by asking whoever want me not t0 be chief.
</br></br>No one raised his hand.
</br></br>He finally started crying and he went out into the forest, saying he wouldn't be part of Ralph's lot anymore.
");

subject(10, "The feast", "After what happened in the meeting, Piggy said that we need to have smoke so we could get rescued. He then suggested to move the fire from the mountain, where the beast was, and make one on the beach That was a great idea!
</br></br>Hours passed and we started to notice that some people disappeared. Maybe they joined Jack's lot.
</br></br>Then, Piggy and I received an invitation to a feast by Jack's tribe. We came.
</br></br>When we arrived, we found a lot of people around the fire. That's where they all went.
</br></br>We ate and Jack tried to convince us to join his tribe (we refused). Then we danced.
");

subject(11, "The murder", "We suddenly heard a big noise. We continued to dance.
</br></br>We saw the beast coming in front of us. Everyone was frightened. The hunters, still dancing, circled it and killed it.
</br></br>We then saw the dead body… of Simon!
</br></br>After this murder, Piggy and I returned with the twins, frightened.
");

subject(12, "The theft", "In the night, there was a noise again. Something then attacked Piggy. Jack's tribe stole Piggy's glasses and we couldn't make a fire anymore.
</br></br>Piggy, the twins and went to Jack's tribe to take back what they stole.
</br></br>When we arrived, they captured the twins, killed Piggy by a rock and broke the conch into a thousand little pieces.
</br></br>They just took the civilisation's and Piggy's lives.
");

subject(13, "\"WANTED\"", "After what happened, I became the only one that haven't joined Jack's lot yet.
</br></br>I hid myself in a thicket near the \"Castle Rock\". I then found the twins guarding the entrance. They told me they I should better go and hide because Jack hates me and want to hunt me the next day.
</br></br>I listened to them and found a hideout.");

subject(14, "The rescue", "The next day, Jack's tribe kept searching me everywhere.
</br></br>One hunter finally found me. I had no choice but to run. I escaped to the beach… where a ship was waiting. Yes, I wasn't dreaming : a ship finally found us!
</br></br>I stopped running, me and the hunters behind me. We would finally go home!
